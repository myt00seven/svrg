This model is a replication of the [BVLC AlexNet Model](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_alexnet), which is slightly different from the original [AlexNet](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) publication.

The trained parameters are from the 65 training epoch. This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.40% (error rate 42.60%), a top-5 accuracy 80.14% (error rate 19.86%) on the validation set, using just the center crop.
